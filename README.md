The project is all about building a toothpaste squeezer based on PocketBeagle. And Cloud 9 IDE is where we write code and test everything.

Most parts are ordered from Inland at MicroCenter. We used Rotary Encoder [Inland Rotary Encoder Module](https://community.microcenter.com/kb/articles/640-inland-rotary-encoder-module). Step motor 28BYJ-48 with ULN 2003a drive board: [Inland Stepper Motor Drive Board](https://community.microcenter.com/kb/articles/675-inland-stepper-motor-drive-board-5v-stepper-motor-3pcs). 1602 I2C display module: [Inland 1602 I2C Module](https://community.microcenter.com/kb/articles/649-inland-1602-i2c-module).
